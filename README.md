# Dictionary-Java-J2EE

I made this set of mini applications that implement simple examples to illustrate a prototype for the different J2EE concepts.

You need to install Tomcat (I used Tomcat 10), run the different apps on the server.

Images or videos are at the root of each mini application to illustrate its execution.

I advise you to read the code files, they are very compact and very readable.
